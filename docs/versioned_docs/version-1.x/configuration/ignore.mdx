# Ignore Files & Folders

You can ignore some files and folders by setting the environment variable `IGNORE` to an ignore pattern. By default everything is shown.

| Pattern | Description |
|---|---|
| `*` | Matches everything (including nothing) |
| `?` | Matches any single character | 
| `[seq]` | Matches any character in seq | 
| `[!seq]` | Matches any character not in seq | 

#### Examples

- `*[ab].txt` hides all files or folder ending with `.txt` and starting with `a` or `b`.

- `.*` hides all files or folder starting with a dot <kbd>.</kbd>

- `[a-zA-Z0-9]*` hides all files or folder starting with a letter or number.

- `[!a-zA-Z0-9]*` hides all files or folder not starting with a letter or number.

- `report-???.pdf` hides `report-001.pdf`, `report-123.pdf` but not `report-1.pdf`.
