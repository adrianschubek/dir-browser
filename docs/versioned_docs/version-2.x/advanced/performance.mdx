# Performance tuning

The performance is already pretty good, but there are a few configuration options that can be tweaked to further improve performance.

## Disable Download count

By default, the download count is enabled. This means that every time a file is downloaded, the download count is incremented by one. This is done by incrementing a Redis key.
However this has a performance impact.

If you don't need the download count, you can disable it by setting the `NO_DL_COUNT` environment variable to `true`.

## Disable Readme Renderer

Set `NO_README_RENDER` to `true` to disable the rendering of README files for improved performance.
