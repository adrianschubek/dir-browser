# Reverse Proxy

For production use, you should use a reverse proxy like [nginx](https://nginx.org/), [traefik](https://traefik.io/traefik/) or [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) to serve the directory browser. This has many advantages, like SSL support, caching and more.

Here are some basic configurations for different reverse proxies. You may need to adjust them to your needs.

<details>
<summary>nginx</summary>

```nginx
server {
  listen 80;
  listen 443 ssl;
  server_name domain.tld;

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080/;
  }

  ssl_certificate /path/to/cert.pem;
  ssl_certificate_key /path/to/cert.key;
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Apache</summary>

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerName domain.tld

  ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:8080/
  ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:8080/
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:443>
  ServerName domain.tld

  ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:8080/
  ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:8080/

  SSLEngine on
  SSLCertificateFile cert.pem
  SSLCertificateKeyFile cert.key
</VirtualHost>
```

</details>

### Subfolder/Different basepath
Since version 1.3.3 you can deploy the application to a different basepath/subfolder e.g. `/foobar/` and all links, files and folders will be relative to this path.

Set the `BASE_PATH` environment variable to the subfolder you want to deploy the application to. For example:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 -e BASE_PATH="/foobar" -v /my/local/folder:/var/www/html/public:ro -v rdb:/var/lib/redis/ -it adrianschubek/dir-browser
```

<!-- import EnvConfig from '@site/src/components/EnvConfig';

<EnvConfig name="BASE_PATH" init="<empty>" values="<path>"/> -->

And you may need to modify your reverse proxy configuration. In NGINX adapt the `location` block to the following:

```nginx
  location /foobar/ {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080/;
  }
```

:::warning
Make sure to add the `/` at the end of the `location` line and after the `proxy_pass` URL. Otherwise the application will not work correctly.
