# Language

dir-browser does not currently provide full UI translations via a `LANGUAGE` environment variable.

If you want to influence language output, the main supported knob is for **relative time strings** (for example “2 days ago”). See [Date & Time](./i18n.md) and use `DATE_FORMAT_RELATIVE_LANG`.
