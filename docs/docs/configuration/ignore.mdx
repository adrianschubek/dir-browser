# Hide Files & Folders

:::info
In contrast to using [metadata](./metadata.md) the file or folder is completely hidden/ignored from the filetree, all APIs and cannot be accessed via URL.
:::

### Ignore patterns

Hide specific files or folders by defining ignore patterns as regular expressions.

Internally, each pattern is evaluated against the full file path using [preg_match](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.preg-match.php). Matching is case-insensitive.
If any pattern matches, the file/folder will be hidden.

Notes:
- The path always starts with `/`, which is the mounted folder.
- Patterns are wrapped as `#<pattern>#im` internally. Avoid using `#` in patterns.
The path always starts with a `/`, which is the mounted folder.

#### Examples

| Pattern | Description | Hidden | Not Hidden |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/\..*` | Hide dotfiles like `.env`, `.git` at any depth | `/foo/.bar`, `/.foo/bar` | `/foo/bar` |
| `^/foo/.*\.txt$` | Hide everything in `/foo` ending with `.txt` | `/foo/abc.txt` | `/foo/abc.md`, `/bar/foo/abc.txt` |
| `^/node_modules/` | Hide `/node_modules` only at the root | `/node_modules` | `/foo/node_modules` |
| `/node_modules/` | Hide `node_modules` at any depth | `/node_modules`, `/foo/node_modules` | `/node_modules_123` |
| `^/reports/2023.*\.pdf$` | Hide PDFs in `/reports` starting with `2023` | `/reports/2023-01.pdf` | `/reports/2022-01.pdf`, `/reports/2023-01.txt` |
| `^/secret/.*\.(jpg\|png)$` | Hide images anywhere under `/secret` | `/secret/foo.jpg`, `/secret/bar/abc.png` | `/secret/foo.png.txt`, `/foo/secret/abc.png` |


You can hide some files and folders by setting the environment variable `IGNORE` to a pattern. By default everything is shown.

<details>
<summary>Legacy (v1.2 - v3.2) ignore pattern matching</summary>

Patterns are matched against the file name and every parent folder name **individually** not as a path.

For example if you have a file `foo/bar/secret.txt`. This path will be split into an array `['foo', 'bar', 'secret.txt']` and each part will be matched against the pattern. If at any point the pattern matches the name, it will be hidden.

Use case: Hide everything starting with a dot <kbd>.</kbd> using a `.*` pattern globally at any nesting level. This will hide `/foo/bar/.foobar`, `/.baz`, `/foo/.secret/bar` etc.

It uses [fnmatch](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.fnmatch.php) to match the pattern.

| Pattern  | Description                            |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `*`      | Matches everything (including nothing) |
| `?`      | Matches any single character           |
| `[seq]`  | Matches any character in seq           |
| `[!seq]` | Matches any character not in seq       |

- pattern `foo` will hide the file `foo/bar/secret.txt` because `foo` matches the first array element `foo`.
- pattern `*bar*` will hide the file `foo/bar/secret.txt` because `*bar*` matches the second array element `bar`.
- pattern `*.txt` will hide the file `foo/bar/secret.txt` because `*.txt` matches the third array element `secret.txt`.

#### Examples

- `*[ab].txt` hides all files or folder ending with either `a.txt` or `b.txt`.

- `.*` hides all files or folder starting with a dot <kbd>.</kbd>

- `[a-zA-Z0-9]*` hides all files or folder starting with a letter or number.

- `[!a-zA-Z0-9]*` hides all files or folder not starting with a letter or number.

- `report-???.pdf` hides `report-001.pdf`, `report-123.pdf` but not `report-1.pdf`.

### Multiple patterns

You can specify multiple patterns and separate them using `;`. If any pattern matches, the file or folder will be hidden.
