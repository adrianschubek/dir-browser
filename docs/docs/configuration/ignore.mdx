# Hide files & folders

:::tip
If you just want to hide a specific file, consider using [metadata](./metadata.md#hidden).
:::

### Exclude patterns

import Upcoming from "@site/src/components/Upcoming";

<Upcoming version="3.3"/>

:::info
Works on path as a whole using regular expressions. This allows for more fine-grained control.

For example if you have a file `foo/bar/secret.txt`. This path will be matched against the pattern. If the pattern matches the path, it will be hidden.

Usecase: Hide some files and fodlers in specific locations only. For example pattern `^foo/secret.txt` hides `foo/secret.txt` but not `/abc/foo/secret.txt`.
:::

It uses [preg_match](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.preg-match.php) to match the pattern.
The clean path is extracted from the URL (removes `?=..`,`#foo`,...) and [urldecoded](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.urldecode) before matching.

### Ignore patterns

:::info
Patterns are matched against the file name and every parent folder name **individually** not as a path.

For example if you have a file `foo/bar/secret.txt`. This path will be split into an array `['foo', 'bar', 'secret.txt']` and each part will be matched against the pattern. If at any point the pattern matches the name, it will be hidden.

Usecase: Hide everything starting with a dot <kbd>.</kbd> using a `.*` pattern globally at any nesting level. This will hide `/foo/bar/.foobar`, `/.baz`, `/foo/.secret/bar` etc.
:::

You can hide some files and folders by setting the environment variable `IGNORE` to a pattern. By default everything is shown.
It uses [fnmatch](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.fnmatch.php) to match the pattern.

| Pattern  | Description                            |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `*`      | Matches everything (including nothing) |
| `?`      | Matches any single character           |
| `[seq]`  | Matches any character in seq           |
| `[!seq]` | Matches any character not in seq       |

- pattern `foo` will hide the file `foo/bar/secret.txt` because `foo` matches the first array element `foo`.
- pattern `*bar*` will hide the file `foo/bar/secret.txt` because `*bar*` matches the second array element `bar`.
- pattern `*.txt` will hide the file `foo/bar/secret.txt` because `*.txt` matches the third array element `secret.txt`.

#### Examples

- `*[ab].txt` hides all files or folder ending with either `a.txt` or `b.txt`.

- `.*` hides all files or folder starting with a dot <kbd>.</kbd>

- `[a-zA-Z0-9]*` hides all files or folder starting with a letter or number.

- `[!a-zA-Z0-9]*` hides all files or folder not starting with a letter or number.

- `report-???.pdf` hides `report-001.pdf`, `report-123.pdf` but not `report-1.pdf`.

### Multiple patterns

<Upcoming version="3.3"/>

You can set multiple patterns and seperate them using a `|`. For example `*.txt|*.md` will hide all files ending with `.txt` or `.md`. If any match is found, the file or folder will be hidden.
