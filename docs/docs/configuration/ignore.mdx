# Ignore files & folders

You can ignore some files and folders by setting the environment variable `IGNORE` to an ignore pattern. By default everything is shown.
It uses [fnmatch](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.fnmatch.php) to match the pattern.

| Pattern  | Description                            |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `*`      | Matches everything (including nothing) |
| `?`      | Matches any single character           |
| `[seq]`  | Matches any character in seq           |
| `[!seq]` | Matches any character not in seq       |

Patterns are matched against the file name and every parent folder name **individually** not as a path.

For example if you have a file `foo/bar/secret.txt`. This path will be split into an array `['foo', 'bar', 'secret.txt']` and each part will be matched against the pattern. If at any point the pattern matches the name, it will be hidden.

- pattern `foo` will hide the file `foo/bar/secret.txt` because `foo` matches the first array element `foo`.
- pattern `*bar*` will hide the file `foo/bar/secret.txt` because `*bar*` matches the second array element `bar`.
- pattern `*.txt` will hide the file `foo/bar/secret.txt` because `*.txt` matches the third array element `secret.txt`.

#### Examples

- `*[ab].txt` hides all files or folder ending with either `a.txt` or `b.txt`.

- `.*` hides all files or folder starting with a dot <kbd>.</kbd>

- `[a-zA-Z0-9]*` hides all files or folder starting with a letter or number.

- `[!a-zA-Z0-9]*` hides all files or folder not starting with a letter or number.

- `report-???.pdf` hides `report-001.pdf`, `report-123.pdf` but not `report-1.pdf`.
