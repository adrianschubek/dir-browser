# CORS

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature implemented by web browsers that allows or restricts web applications running at one origin to make requests to resources from another origin. 

By default any origin is allowed to access the resources of the server. However, you can restrict access to the same origin by setting the `CORS_ALLOW_ANY_ORIGIN` environment variable to `false`.

import EnvConfig from '@site/src/components/EnvConfig';

<EnvConfig name="CORS_ALLOW_ANY_ORIGIN" init="true" values="true,false" versions="3.13"/>
