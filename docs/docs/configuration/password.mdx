# Password protection

:::info

While there is no built-in password protection currently, you can use your reverse proxy to add it easily. 
A built-in authentication feature is planned for a future release.

:::

You can restrict access to the dir-browser with a password. This is useful if you want to share your files with others but don't want to make them public.

1. Generate a `.htpasswd` file with the following command. You may need to install the `apache2-utils` package first.
```bash
htpasswd -c .htpasswd <username>
```
Make sure to enter a password.

2. Modify your reverse proxy.

<details>
<summary>Apache</summary>

```apache
<VirtualHost *:443>
  // green-next-line
  AuthType Basic
  // green-next-line
  AuthName "Authentication required"
  // green-next-line
  AuthUserFile /path/to/.htpasswd
  // green-next-line
  Require valid-user
</VirtualHost>
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>nginx</summary>

```nginx
  location / {
    // green-next-line
    auth_basic "Authentication required";
    // green-next-line
    auth_basic_user_file /path/to/.htpasswd;
  }
```

</details>

3. Now your browser will ask for a username and password.
