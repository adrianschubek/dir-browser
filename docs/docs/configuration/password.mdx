# Password protection

A file can be protected with a password, which is stored in a [dbmeta.json](/configuration/metadata.md) file.

Protected files can only be downloaded/viewed after unlocking them with the correct password. However, they are still visible in the file tree.

Protected files will display a key icon next to their name in the file tree.

### Defining a password

See [Metadata](metadata.md) for more information on how to define metadata for a file.

```json title="/.local/foo bar/bla bla.txt.dbmeta.json"
{
  "password": "foobar"
}
```

:::info
At this time, only files can be protected with a password, not directories. This may change in the future.

### Accessing a protected file

#### Via UI

When accessing a protected file, you will be prompted to enter the password.

https://dir-demo.adriansoftware.de/examples/foo%20%20%20bar/bla%20bla.txt

<Image img={require("@site/static/img/pw2.png")} />

#### GET request

You can also specify the password as a `key` parameter in the URL:

https://dir-demo.adriansoftware.de/examples/foo%20%20%20bar/bla%20bla.txt?key=foobar

#### POST request

Or as part of a POST request

```
curl -X POST https://dir-demo.adriansoftware.de/examples/foo%20%20%20bar/bla%20bla.txt -d "key=foobar"
```
