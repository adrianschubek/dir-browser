# Format

## Date & Time

The date and time format for files/folders can be changed by setting the environment variable `DATE_FORMAT` when starting the container.

<!-- table with options: relative, local, utc -->
| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `local` | Format based on user's localized date format (e.g. `12.1.2024, 04:36:30` in German) |
| `utc`  | UTC time (e.g. `2021-08-01 12:32:55 UTC`) |
| `relative` (Default) | Relative time based on user's localized date format (e.g. `2 days ago` in English) |

All times will be displayed in the user's local timezone.

When using the `relative` format you can override the language by setting the environment variable `DATE_FORMAT_RELATIVE_LANG` when starting the container (e.g. `DATE_FORMAT_RELATIVE_LANG=de` will output relative times in German). By default it uses the locale of the user.

:::info
To change it, set the environment variable `DATE_FORMAT` to a value listed above when starting the container. 
```
DATE_FORMAT=relative
```
